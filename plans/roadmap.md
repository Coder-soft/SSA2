- **M1.2** (September 2025): Create HTML component system - COMPLETED
- **M1.3** (October 2025): Enhanced attribute handling and validation - COMPLETED

### Features
- `!html[<tag>content</tag>]` syntax - IMPLEMENTED
- Component definition and usage - IMPLEMENTED
- Improved error handling for malformed HTML - IMPLEMENTED

## Phase 2: Extended Execution Capabilities (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)

### Goals
- Add JavaScript execution support
- Implement data visualization syntax
- Create file inclusion mechanism

### Milestones
- **M2.1** (November 2025): JavaScript execution blocks
- **M2.2** (December 2025): Data visualization syntax
- **M2.3** (January 2026): File inclusion syntax
- **M2.4** (February 2026): Testing and optimization

### Features
- `js-power` code blocks
- Chart and graph visualization syntax
- `!include[file]` directive

## Phase 3: Advanced Document Features (Q2 - Q3 2026)

### Goals
- Implement variable system
- Add conditional content
- Create loop syntax

### Milestones
- **M3.1** (March 2026): Variable system
- **M3.2** (April 2026): Conditional content
- **M3.3** (May 2026): Loop syntax
- **M3.4** (June 2026): Integration testing

### Features
- Variable definition and usage
- Conditional blocks (`!if`, `!else`)
- Iteration syntax (`!for`)

## Phase 4: Plugin System and Math Support (Q4 2026 - Q1 2027)

### Goals
- Develop plugin architecture
- Add advanced math expression support

### Milestones
- **M4.1** (July 2026): Plugin system design
- **M4.2** (August 2026): Plugin API implementation
- **M4.3** (September 2026): Math expression support
- **M4.4** (October 2026): Documentation and examples

### Features
- Third-party plugin support
- Math expression rendering
- Plugin marketplace (future consideration)

## Quality Assurance

Each phase will include:
- Unit tests for new functionality
- Integration tests with existing features
- Performance benchmarks
- Security audits for execution features
- User documentation

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Increase in active users
- **Stability**: Reduction in bug reports
- **Performance**: Improvement in compilation speed
- **Community**: Growth in contributions and feedback

## Risks and Mitigation

1. **Security Concerns**
   - Risk: Execution blocks could introduce vulnerabilities
   - Mitigation: Implement strict sandboxing and code review

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Risk: New features could slow compilation
   - Mitigation: Profile and optimize critical paths

3. **Complexity Overload**
   - Risk: Too many features could confuse users
   - Mitigation: Maintain clean documentation and examples

## Community Involvement

- Solicit feature requests through GitHub issues
- Create beta testing program for new features
- Develop contributor guidelines
- Host monthly community meetings

This roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback, technical challenges, and resource availability.
